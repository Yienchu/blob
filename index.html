                <h1>For cutesy Fi</h1> 
    <p>Hi, Fi! I have alot to tell you but i'll be saving it for future projects. LOL So first things first, i do want you to know how much i like you, a biiig size, similar to Neptune and it's still growing more as time passes and as i get to know you more. i hope the day i'm ready to give you entirety of my heart, you are ready and would do the same, i really hope na i wont watch you walk away with it helplessly. 
     <br><br>The day i give you the entirety of my heart, i hope you'll handle it with care as that is very fragile like a glass that with just one tap it will shatter; it hold all of my emotions, fears, dreams, secrets, and my very whole personality afterall. And i will do the same to yours, i will handle it with very care like how i would handle a toddler. I want you to feel na you can be your very true self around me, without fear of judgement or critiques, so rest assured na i will treat your heart with the care and respect you very deserve. I want to be the person who will help you take down the walls gently without pushing or forcing it just like the fall of the Berlin wall. Your very feelings and your thoughts, matter to me, and i'll always listen to it with my ears and heart focusing solely on you. If you're feeling overwhelmed or a problem arises and you can't take it anymore, you can always lean on me, Kate is there too, if you have the need to cry something out, i'm here for you; likewise if you just need my presense just say so, i'll hang out with you in silence. I'm not going anywhere, i will always be here for youzzzz.
      <br><br> akgnjdtnyjst your eyes--- those two circle pools of endless light it is glistening like the first stars that appears in the night, in them, my world finds its quiet peace, a universe that shines brightly and doesn't cease. They hold a story that have yet been told, a million dreams that are both shy and v bold. And when you smile... oh, how my world begins to sing, your smile and laugh dances, so soft and bright that brings positivity to everyone. A melody. 
      <br><br> Sincerely yours, Yuan
